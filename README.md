Concrete Strength Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the compressive strength of concrete using various machine learning models. The dataset contains information about different components of concrete mixtures and the resulting strength.
Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:

CementComponent
BlastFurnaceSlag
FlyAshComponent
WaterComponent
SuperplasticizerComponent
CoarseAggregateComponent
FineAggregateComponent
AgeInDays

The target variable is 'Strength', which represents the compressive strength of the concrete.
Models Implemented

Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Decision Tree Regressor
K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
CatBoost Regressor
Voting Regressor (ensemble of the above models)

Project Structure

Data preprocessing: Handling missing values and feature scaling
Model training and evaluation
Performance comparison of different models
Final prediction on the test set

Results
The performance of each model was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R2 Score. The Gradient Boosting Regressor showed the best performance among the individual models.
How to Run

Ensure you have the required libraries installed (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, catboost)
Load the training and test datasets
Run the notebook cells sequentially to train models and generate predictions
The final predictions will be saved in a 'submission.csv' file

Future Improvements

Feature engineering to create new meaningful features
Hyperparameter tuning for each model
Trying other ensemble methods or advanced techniques like stacking
Analyzing feature importance to gain insights into the most influential factors
